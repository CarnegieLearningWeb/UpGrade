## Client Lib Tester

This application allows you to test various client library versions against simulated client code usage.

The use-cases for this application are to:

1. anticipate how rolling out new changes will affect consumers
2. verify backwards compatibility
3. debug release/production issues
4. POC and/or test new release features

... WITHOUT deployments or asking consumers to make changes on our behalf.

The end goal is to allow us to release new library / API changes with minimal disruption to consumers.
