ok so:

It sort of works, demo-able.

There are a lot of hard-coded things.

1. It needs to load in local branch client libs when doing npm install via preinstall npm script <-- this second
2. It needs to have a user-creation interface, and a user service to emit latest user details via event bus. <-- this first
3. It maybe doesn't really need logging in interface, dev console is pretty good...
4. The app needs to emit it's own interfaceModel details so it is not hard-coded. <-- this third
5. Need to make sure it can switch between apps (not all that important for now, but could be buggy)
6. Needs cleaned up.
7. The apps need to also have a selection for passing the scenario OR need to clone the app for different versions? <-- this fourth
8. Keep mindful that it needs to be workable for a backend Java server version.

Event-bus is for de-coupled communicating tester and test-app selections to the mock-app.
